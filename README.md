This is a single web app that features a fictional website for a mobile app, Tindog where dogs date each other. 

It features a number of things:
-Bootstrap
-Responsive Design
-Bootstrap Grid System

Among others. This website was instrumental in solidifying my knowledge and skill in using the front-end framework Bootstrap, which I find to be one of my favorite front-end frameworks.
